            tab: Growth
            commentAbove: When health drops below this value, the snake prioritizes finding food over maximizing space. Higher values make the snake greedier.

            tab: Growth
            commentAbove: Multiplier for food-seeking behavior when hungry. Higher values make the snake more determined to reach food, even if it means taking riskier paths.

            label: Space Weight
            tab: Board Area
            commentAbove: Multiplier for space-maximizing behavior when not hungry. Higher values make the snake prefer directions with more total reachable area.

            label: Escape Route Weight
            tab: Board Area
            commentAbove: Bonus for moves that have multiple escape routes. Higher values make the snake avoid dead ends and prefer positions with 2-3 possible exits.

            label: Openness Weight
            tab: Board Area
            commentAbove: Bonus for wide open spaces over narrow corridors. Higher values make the snake prefer directions where it can move freely in multiple directions immediately.

        centerPreference:
            label: Center Preference
            tab: Board Area
            commentAbove: How strongly the snake prefers moving toward the board center. Higher values help avoid getting trapped in corners but may lead to more confrontations.

            label: Trap Avoidance
            tab: Board Area
            commentAbove: Penalty for entering positions with few escape routes. Higher values make the snake heavily avoid moves with 0-1 exits, preventing death traps.

            label: Lookahead Depth
            tab: Board Area
            commentAbove: How many turns ahead to predict tail movement. Higher values help recognize when following a tail will create space, but increases computation.
            type: range
            span: auto

        targetLead:
            label: Target Lead
            tab: Opponents
            commentAbove: How many units bigger than the largest opponent the snake tries to be. Higher values make the snake eat more aggressively to build/maintain a size advantage.
            type: range
            span: auto

        growthPriority:
            label: Growth Priority
            tab: Opponents
            commentAbove: Multiplier for size-advantage seeking. Higher values raise the food threshold more aggressively when below the target lead.

        aggression:
            label: Aggression
            tab: Opponents
            commentAbove: How aggressively the snake hunts smaller opponents. At 0, the snake ignores other snakes. At 1, it actively pursues head-to-head collisions with smaller snakes.
            type: range

            label: Enemy Prediction
            tab: Opponents
            commentAbove: How much to factor in where enemies might move next. Higher values make the snake more cautious about spaces enemies could reach, but may be overly defensive.

        trappingAggression:
            label: Trapping Aggression
            tab: Opponents
            commentAbove: Bonus for moves that reduce opponents' accessible area. Only active when we're the largest snake. Higher values make the snake actively cut off opponents' escape routes.
            type: range
            span: auto

        avoidLargerSnakes:
            label: Avoid Larger Snakes
            tab: Opponents
            commentAbove: When enabled, the snake avoids moving adjacent to larger snake heads to prevent losing head-to-head collisions.
